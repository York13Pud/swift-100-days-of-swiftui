## Type Annotations

Swift is able to figure out what type of data a constant or variable holds based on what we assign to it. However, sometimes we don’t want to assign a value immediately, or sometimes we want to override Swift’s choice of type, and that’s where type annotations come in.

To specify a type, do the following:

``` swift
let surname:String = "Lasso"
var score:Int = 0
```
