# Day One

## Why Swift?

* Hard to write unsafe code
* Makes it easy to write code that is clear to understand
* Supports all the worlds languages out of the box

## Creating Constants And Variables

### Variables

Example of a variable in Swift:

``` swift
var name = "Ted"
```

To assign a new value to the name variable:

``` swift
name = "Fred"
```

`var` is only used when you create the variable. It is not needed when assigning a new value.

### Constants

Constants are used when the value will not change. To create a constant:

``` swift
let drink = "Tea"
```

Attempting to assign a new value to a constant will result in an error.
